<p>Share your thoughts, write posts, show your favorite music via Spotify, chat with friends, find love, make groups, earn badges and much more!
Let's build an awakened community with similar interests</p>
<br>
<i>"We intend to develop a safe and positive platform for everyone. Nokusocial is going to be different in every sense."</i>
<br><br>
<li><b>Support</b> - This project is not backed by Big Tech Giants, nor is there a line of investors to back this initiative. We are real people longing for real change in the world of social media consumerism. Our mission at Noku is connection, freedom of speech, and truth, without any strings attached. Because our platform is solely crowdfund-based, we invite community support in making our platform not only a great user experience, but also under consistent improvement</li>
<li><b>Owing to people</b> - Since we are building this platform with solely crowdfunding efforts, Noku entirely owes its services to those in the community. At Noku, we value fairness and protection for our users, and hold feedback and support of our users as the most important. Noku is built by us, with your support, for you.</li>
<li><b>Decremental support</b> - Over time and throughout our building process, our user subscription will decrease overtime, until it is a rate of 1.99$ per month.</li>
